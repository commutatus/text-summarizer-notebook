    "input= {\"inputs\": \"1 consultation paper on green and blue bonds as a mode of sustainable finance 1. Background 1.1 sustainable finance is the process of taking due account of environmental, social and governance (esg) considerations while making investment decisions in the financial sector, leading to increased longer-term investments into sustainable economic activities and projects.1 1.2 the need for sustainable finance was felt in the aftermath of repeated environmental disasters and extreme weather events, corporate finance being driven purely by profit motives and corporate governance norms being followed as the exception rather than the norm. This has been bolstered by the demand for sustainable avenues of investments from a section of the new- age investors as well as with the substantial rise in the prominence of the stakeholders theory over shareholders theory. 1.3 the cop 26 mandate: in the 2021 united nations climate change conference, more commonly referred to as cop26, held in glasgow, scotland, 197 countries, including india, have made enhanced commitments towards mitigating climate change and promising more climate finance for developing countries to adapt to climate impacts. This means that sustainable finance will be the mainstay of world business, which in turn, will mean more demand for funds in this domain. 2. Sebis regulatory regime on green bonds: 2.1 the concept of green debt securities was introduced under the erstwhile securities and exchange board of india (issue and listing of debt securities) regulations, 2008 vide circular dated may 30, 20172. 2.2 regulation 2(1)(q) of the securities and exchange board of india (issue and listing of non- convertible securities) regulations (ncs regulations) defines green debt security, which reads as under: green debt security means a debt security issued for raising funds that are to be utilised for project(s) and/or asset(s) falling under any of the following categories, subject to the conditions as may be specified by the board from time to time: (i) renewable and sustainable energy including wind, solar, bioenergy, other sources of energy which use clean technology, (ii) clean transportation including mass/public transportation, (iii) sustainable water management including clean and/or drinking water, water recycling, 1 https: //www. Worldbank. Org/en/topic/financialsector/brief/sustainable-finance 2 subsumed in the operational circular on the ncs regulations, 2021 please see chapter ix page 1 of 15 2 (iv) climate change adaptation, (v) energy efficiency including efficient and green buildings, (vi) sustainable waste management including recycling, waste to energy, efficient disposal of wastage, (vii) sustainable land use including sustainable forestry and agriculture, afforestation, (viii) biodiversity conservation, or (ix) a category as may be specified by the board, from time to time 2.3 further, chapter ix of the operational circular on the ncs regulations, 2021 dated august 10, 2021, as amended on date, specifies the following with reference to issuers of green debt securities: a. Additional disclosure requirements in the offer document; b. Continuous disclosure requirements in annual report and financial results; c. Responsibilities of the issuer. 3. Mandate of this consultation paper 3.1. Since the framework of green debt securities was laid down by sebi, there have been multiple events in the sustainable finance space around the world, thereby necessitating a review in the indian context. 3.2. In this context, sebi, through this consultation paper, is seeking public comments on a proposed regulatory framework: a. To amplify the definition of green debt securities, b. To introduce the concept of blue bonds c. To reduce the compliance cost for issuers of green debt securities with while not creating any perverse incentives that may lead to greenwashing. 3.3. Suggestions are also solicited towards increasing avenues for sustainable finance in india, while considering indias unique goals of pursuing high growth with sustainable development. 3.4. This consultation paper follows a series of discussions held with multiple stakeholders, including the sub-committee formed under the corporate bonds securitization advisory committee (cobosac) of sebi. 4. Global scenario 4.1 issuance of green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked (gsss) bonds as a percentage of total global bond issuance rose from roughly 2 per cent at the start of 2018 to a peak of over 12 per cent at the end of 20213. Prices continued to rise as the demand from investors exploded. Figures from data provider epfr, as given in the graph below, show that flows into esg and socially responsible investing bond funds rose from a net of $4.2bn in 2018 to $102bn in 2021. 3 https: //www. Ft. Com/content/32dbf37c-8ff5-436b-88f3-9873fc864a7b page 2 of 15 3 4.2 with economic growth slowing globally owing to high inflation, high commodity prices and higher interest rates issuers of bonds, both green and conventional, have pulled back. As the sustainable bonds are subject to the same headwinds as that of the broader market, green bond issuances in this year are expected to be roughly in line with 2021. That is a notable slowdown, given how quickly the market has been growing. Despite the above fact, rating agencies forecast that global issuance of gsss bonds will be around $1tn this year4. 5. Present fund raising through green bonds india 5.1. As per the economic survey 2019-205, climate bonds worth usd 10.3 billion were issued in the first half of 2019 in india. Climate bonds in india are focused on green bonds, which are specifically linked to climate-change mitigation, adaptation and resilience. 5.2. A number of government agencies have contributed to issuance of such bonds, particularly indian renewable energy development agency (ireda) and the indian railway finance corporation (irfc). 5.3. Currently, green bonds raised by various issuers are listed on india inx. Similarly, various issuers have also issued and listed their bonds on other international stock exchanges such as luxembourg se, singapore exchange, etc. 5.4. Indian companies raised nearly usd 7 billion through esg and green bonds in 2021, compared to usd 1.4 billion and usd 4 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. 5.5. As of february 12, 2020, the outstanding amount of green bonds in india was us$16.3 billion. 4 https: //www. Climatebonds. Net/2022/01/500bn-green-issuance-2021-social-and-sustainable-acceleration-annual-green-1tn- sight-market 5 https: //www. Indiabudget. Gov. In/budget2020-21/economicsurvey/index. Php page 3 of 15 4 5.6. As per economic survey 2020-21 and emerging markets green bonds report 2020, india occupies the 2nd spot (after china) in the cumulative emerging market green bond issuance, 2012-20206. Cumulative emerging market green bond issuance, 2012-2020 (us$ million) 5.7. The above graph shows that in most countries, green bond issuances by corporate entities vastly exceed the issuances by government/ sovereign agencies. The only exceptions are chile, poland, indonesia, hungary, egypt and argentina. 5.8. As on june 30, 2022, under the sebi framework for green bonds, 14 issuers have raised rs. 4,539 crore (about $ 0.5 billion). 6 https: //www. Indiabudget. Gov. In/budget2021-22/economicsurvey/index. Php page 4 of 15 5 5.9. As can be seen from above, there is a stark divergence between the amount raised by listing green bonds in indian jurisdictions versus foreign jurisdictions or autonomous jurisdictions like inx (india international exchange). It may be noted that issuers are finding it more attractive to list on bourses falling outside sebi framework. 5.10. Most of the green bonds issued by indian issuers are listed on offshore exchanges. Informal consultation with the industry participants attribute this to: - lack of demand for such bonds among the indian investors - favourable pricing in overseas market. 6. Scope for sustainable finance in india 6.1 at the cop-26 summit in glasgow, india had made the following commitments towards its climate change goals7: a. Raising non-fossil fuel based energy capacity to 500 gw. B. Lowering total projected carbon emission by one billion tons. C. Meeting 50% of the countrys energy needs through renewable sources. D. Reduce the carbon intensity of the economy to sub 45% level. E. Commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. 6.2 government of india has initiated the following schemes/ policies in pursuit of the goals towards cop-26 targets: a. Commission on air quality management (caqm) - phasing out of coal use in national capital region from january 2023, but exempting thermal power plants using low- sulphur coal. B. National biomass co-firing policy to use biomass like paddy stubble and cow-dung in coal power plants8. C.

Whether the above mentioned initiatives offer any scope for financing through green bonds? B. Please offer comments on whether there are any additional policies/ schemes in line with the above objective, if any? 7. Potential in emerging areas 7.1. The sub-committee constituted by the cobosac had presented its report, which has covered areas like priority sector lending to green sectors, investment by institutional investors, tax recommendation for green bonds and updation of extant guidelines in line with updated green bond principles published by the international capital markets association13. 7.2. There is a need to further channel the investment in emerging areas like data centers which are receiving policy traction (draft data center policy). This field assumes importance in light of government push for data localization and the storage necessities for large volumes of data collected in india. Data centers need tremendous cooling facilities, some of which can be attractive avenues for sustainable finance. 7.3. New concepts like circular economy and regional resource based manufacturing are gaining currency, as a mode to balance job creation with inter-generational environmental equity. Though definitions of these need deeper analysis, there is a need for encouraging flow of green finance in these initiatives. The government of india has presented schemes like one district one product, zero effect zero defect and promotion of these goods through local post offices and railway stations. 7.4. Ecosystem services evaluation- the natural capital accounting and valuation of ecosystem services (ncaves) india forum is being organized by ministry of statistics and programme implementation (mospi) in collaboration with the united nations statistics division (unsd), european union and un environment. India has also implemented the system of environmental economic accounting (seea) which provides policy makers and decision-makers with information that accounts for the value nature contributes to our economies.14 7.5. Agritech companies investing in net-zero for agriculture: - agriculture and allied sectors like animal husbandry are responsible for over 85% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

According to the world bank, the blue economy is the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem. 17 european commission defines it as all economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts. 8.2. For a country like india that has a 7500 km long coastline and 14,500 km of navigable inland waterways, the development of blue economy can serve as a growth catalyst in realizing the vision to become a $10 trillion economy by 2032. The blue economy currently comprises 4.1% of indias economy. 8.3. The government of india has kickstarted the initiative to develop the blue economy by announcing project sagarmala, a first of its kind port-led development programme in india. The sagarmala programme plans to bring in development around india's coastal regions based on the following four pillars: port modernization & new port development, port connectivity enhancement & port-linked industrialization. 8.4. The ministry of earth sciences (moes) has rolled out the draft blue economy policy, inviting suggestions and inputs from various stakeholders. 8.5. It emphasizes policies across several key sectors to achieve holistic growth of indias economy. It recognizes the following thematic areas: a. National accounting framework for the blue economy and ocean governance. B. Coastal marine spatial planning and tourism. C. Marine fisheries, aquaculture, and fish processing. D. Manufacturing, emerging industries, trade, technology, services, and skill development. E. Logistics, infrastructure and shipping, including trans-shipments. F. Coastal and deep-sea mining and offshore energy. G. Security, strategic dimensions, and international engagement. H. Indias exclusive economic zone of over 2 million square kilometres has a huge living and non-living resources with significant recoverable resources such as crude oil and natural gas. 9. Scope of blue bonds in india india has tremendous scope for deployment of blue bonds in various aspects of the blue economy, like: 9.1 oceanic resource mining: polymetallic nodules and methane hydrates are abundant in the indian ocean region. Mining of polymetallic nodules present in the seabed in the central indian ocean basin can help india improve availability of nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese. Through an agreement with the international seabed authority, india has a right to explore and mine polymetallic nodules over 750,000 square km.18 17 https: //www. Worldbank.

Relid=170138 page 7 of 15 8 9.2 sustainable fishing: as the developing countries face new challenges at wto to phase out illegal, unreported and unregulated (iuu) fishing, it is time the country phases out exploitative fishing devices like bottom trawlers. India has an exclusive economic zone of 2.37 million sq. Km. 9.3 national offshore wind energy policy: ministry has set a target of 5.0 gw of offshore wind installations by 2022 and 30 gw by 2030 which has been issued to give confidence to the project developers in indian market. 9.4 coral degradation: india can invest in technologies like biorock to rejuvenate the corals along its coastline, by forming an artificial substrate. 9.5 india has acceded to the marine pollution (marpol) convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes. 9.6 geoengineering techniques like ocean fertilization or ocean nourishment is a type of climate engineering based on the purposeful introduction of plant nutrients to the upper ocean to increase marine food production and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 9.7 blue flag beach is an eco-tourism model endeavouring to provide the tourists/ beachgoers clean and hygienic bathing water, facilities, a safe and healthy environment and sustainable development of the area.19 9.8 views/ comments sought on: a. Whether the above mentioned initiatives offer any scope for financing through blue bonds? B. Whether introducing coloured bonds (blue bonds for blue economy, yellow bonds for solar power) will help increase channels for funding to green projects? C. Please offer comments on whether any additional policies/ schemes, if any? 10.

Is there a need to revisit the existing green bond framework on the lines of the gbps mentioned above? If so, which are the recommendations that have to be adopted? B. Please offer comments on whether any additional policies/ schemes, if any. 11. Greenwashing 11.1. One of the main hurdles for further growth has been a consistent and robust approach to identifying what is considered green. A lack of clarity in this regard leads greenwashing which is defined as the practice of channelling proceeds from green bonds towards projects or activities having negligible or negative environmental benefits. Various issuers page 13 of 15 14 in the past have been accused of greenwashing, and the same has caused significant reputational risk for socially conscious investors seeking to diversify their investment portfolios by investing in environmental, social and governance (esg) practices. 11.2. Bankers and lenders are cautious about financing new asset classes in the green bond market in the absence of adherence to widely accepted standards and taxonomies. On the other hand, no issuer would want to risk their reputation by issuing a bond which is criticized for not being adequately green or transformational, particularly due to lack of availability of a domestic green assessment framework to rate them in a transparent and uniform manner. 11.3. Sebi guidelines on green bonds provide a list of categories wherein funds raised through debt securities are eligible to be classified as green debt securities. 11.4. While china and the european union (eu) have issued their own taxonomies regarding assets eligible to be financed through green bonds, india does not have a detailed taxonomy of such assets. Further, in the absence of the same, major issuers such as sbi, yes bank, ireda etc. Have their own internal green bond frameworks to identify and finance projects. 11.5. In this regard, it is proposed that the list of sectors identified as eligible under the sebi framework may be updated in line with the updated icma guidelines and market feedback/public consultations. 11.6. As per extant regulations, green bonds which do not permit recourse to the issuer are not available in india. However, green revenue bonds or green project bonds as defined by icma are not envisaged under extant sebi regulations. 11.7. Similarly, securitized debt obligations as defined under sebi (issue and listing of securitized debt instruments and security receipts) regulations, 2008 that may have green assets in their underlying asset pool are also excluded from the current framework. 11.8. Feedback is sought regarding addition of such alternative debt securities as defined by icma to be considered as eligible green debt securities. An indicative description of the same is as follows: a. Green revenue bonds which limit exposure to the green project being financed and does not provide recourse to the issuer may b. Green project bond which provides for credit exposure to a single / multiple green projects, with or without recourse to the issuer c. Green securitized bonds collateralized by cash flows from the projects. 11.9. Views/ comments sought on: a. Whether such sub-categorization of green bonds will help reduce greenwashing? B. Please offer comments on whether any additional regulatory/ technical solutions against greenwashing? Page 14 of 15 15 12.

    "#text=\"\"\" manager in connection with manipulative trading in the securities of HD View 360 Inc., a U.S.-based microcap issuer.  The SEC also announced charges against HD View's CEO, another individual, and three entities they control for manipulating HD View's securities as well as the securities of another microcap issuer, West Coast Ventures Group Corp.  The SEC further announced the institution of an order suspending trading in the securities of HD View.These charges arise in part from an undercover operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which also resulted in related criminal prosecutions against these defendants by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Beaufort Securities Ltd. and Peter Kyriacou, an investment manager at Beaufort, manipulated the market for HD View's common stock.  The scheme involved an undercover FBI agent who described his business as manipulating U.S. stocks through pump-and-dump schemes.  Kyriacou and the agent discussed depositing large blocks of microcap stock in Beaufort accounts, driving up the price of the stock through promotions, manipulating the stock's price and volume through matched trades, and then selling the shares for a large profit.The SEC's complaint against Beaufort and Kyriacou alleges that they:opened brokerage accounts for the undercover agent in the names of nominees in order to conceal his identity and his connection to the anticipated trading activity in the accounts suggested that the undercover agent could create the false appearance that HD View's stock was liquid in advance of a pump-and-dump by \"gam[ing] the market\" through matched trades executed multiple purchase orders of HD View shares with the understanding that Beaufort's client had arranged for an associate to simultaneously offer an equivalent number of shares at the same priceA second complaint filed by the SEC in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleges that in a series of recorded telephone conversations with the undercover agent, HD View CEO Dennis Mancino and William T. Hirschy agreed to manipulate HD View's common stock by using the agent's network of brokers to generate fraudulent retail demand for the stock in exchange for a kickback from the trading proceeds.  According to the complaint, the three men agreed that Mancino and Hirschy would manipulate HD View stock to a higher price before using the agent's brokers to liquidate their positions at an artificially inflated price.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that Mancino and Hirschy executed a \"test trade\" on Jan. 31, 2018, coordinated by the agent, consisting of a sell order placed by the defendants filled by an opposing purchase order placed by a broker into an account at Beaufort.  Unbeknownst to Mancino and Hirschy, the Beaufort account used for this trade was a nominal account that was opened and funded by the agent.  The SEC's complaint also alleges that, prior to their contact with the undercover agent, Mancino and Hirschy manipulated the market for HD View and for West Coast by using brokerage accounts that they owned, controlled, or were associated with –including TJM Investments Inc., DJK Investments 10 Inc., WT Consulting Group LLC – to effect manipulative \"matched trades.\"The SEC's complaint against Beaufort and Kyriacou charges the defendants with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC also charged Hirschy, Mancino, and their corporate entities with violating Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 9(a)(1), 9(a)(2), and 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, and penny stock bars from Beaufort and Kyriacou.  With respect to Hirschy, Mancino, and their corporate entities, the SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, penny stock bars, and an officer-and-director bar against Mancino.The investigation was conducted in the SEC's New York Regional Office by Tejal Shah and Joseph Darragh, Lorraine Collazo, and Michael D. Paley of the Microcap Fraud Task Force and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban, and in Washington, D.C. by Patrick L. Feeney, Robert Nesbitt, and Kevin Guerrero, and supervised by Antonia Chion.  Preethi Krishnamurthy and Ms. Shah will lead the SEC's litigation against Beaufort and Kyriacou.  Ann H. Petalas and Mr. Feeney, under the supervision of Cheryl Crumpton, will handle the SEC's litigation against Mancino, Hirschy, and their entities.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Alberta Securities Commission, the Ontario Securities Commission, the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.The Commission's investigation in this matter is continuing.\"\"\"\n",
    "text=\"1 consultation paper on green and blue bonds as a mode of sustainable finance 1. Background 1.1 sustainable finance is the process of taking due account of environmental, social and governance (esg) considerations while making investment decisions in the financial sector, leading to increased longer-term investments into sustainable economic activities and projects.1 1.2 the need for sustainable finance was felt in the aftermath of repeated environmental disasters and extreme weather events, corporate finance being driven purely by profit motives and corporate governance norms being followed as the exception rather than the norm. This has been bolstered by the demand for sustainable avenues of investments from a section of the new- age investors as well as with the substantial rise in the prominence of the stakeholders theory over shareholders theory. 1.3 the cop 26 mandate: in the 2021 united nations climate change conference, more commonly referred to as cop26, held in glasgow, scotland, 197 countries, including india, have made enhanced commitments towards mitigating climate change and promising more climate finance for developing countries to adapt to climate impacts. This means that sustainable finance will be the mainstay of world business, which in turn, will mean more demand for funds in this domain. 2. Sebis regulatory regime on green bonds: 2.1 the concept of green debt securities was introduced under the erstwhile securities and exchange board of india (issue and listing of debt securities) regulations, 2008 vide circular dated may 30, 20172. 2.2 regulation 2(1)(q) of the securities and exchange board of india (issue and listing of non- convertible securities) regulations (ncs regulations) defines green debt security, which reads as under: green debt security means a debt security issued for raising funds that are to be utilised for project(s) and/or asset(s) falling under any of the following categories, subject to the conditions as may be specified by the board from time to time: (i) renewable and sustainable energy including wind, solar, bioenergy, other sources of energy which use clean technology, (ii) clean transportation including mass/public transportation, (iii) sustainable water management including clean and/or drinking water, water recycling, 1 https: //www. Worldbank. Org/en/topic/financialsector/brief/sustainable-finance 2 subsumed in the operational circular on the ncs regulations, 2021 please see chapter ix page 1 of 15 2 (iv) climate change adaptation, (v) energy efficiency including efficient and green buildings, (vi) sustainable waste management including recycling, waste to energy, efficient disposal of wastage, (vii) sustainable land use including sustainable forestry and agriculture, afforestation, (viii) biodiversity conservation, or (ix) a category as may be specified by the board, from time to time 2.3 further, chapter ix of the operational circular on the ncs regulations, 2021 dated august 10, 2021, as amended on date, specifies the following with reference to issuers of green debt securities: a. Additional disclosure requirements in the offer document; b. Continuous disclosure requirements in annual report and financial results; c. Responsibilities of the issuer. 3. Mandate of this consultation paper 3.1. Since the framework of green debt securities was laid down by sebi, there have been multiple events in the sustainable finance space around the world, thereby necessitating a review in the indian context. 3.2. In this context, sebi, through this consultation paper, is seeking public comments on a proposed regulatory framework: a. To amplify the definition of green debt securities, b. To introduce the concept of blue bonds c. To reduce the compliance cost for issuers of green debt securities with while not creating any perverse incentives that may lead to greenwashing. 3.3. Suggestions are also solicited towards increasing avenues for sustainable finance in india, while considering indias unique goals of pursuing high growth with sustainable development. 3.4. This consultation paper follows a series of discussions held with multiple stakeholders, including the sub-committee formed under the corporate bonds securitization advisory committee (cobosac) of sebi. 4. Global scenario 4.1 issuance of green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked (gsss) bonds as a percentage of total global bond issuance rose from roughly 2 per cent at the start of 2018 to a peak of over 12 per cent at the end of 20213. Prices continued to rise as the demand from investors exploded. Figures from data provider epfr, as given in the graph below, show that flows into esg and socially responsible investing bond funds rose from a net of $4.2bn in 2018 to $102bn in 2021. 3 https: //www. Ft. Com/content/32dbf37c-8ff5-436b-88f3-9873fc864a7b page 2 of 15 3 4.2 with economic growth slowing globally owing to high inflation, high commodity prices and higher interest rates issuers of bonds, both green and conventional, have pulled back. As the sustainable bonds are subject to the same headwinds as that of the broader market, green bond issuances in this year are expected to be roughly in line with 2021. That is a notable slowdown, given how quickly the market has been growing. Despite the above fact, rating agencies forecast that global issuance of gsss bonds will be around $1tn this year4. 5. Present fund raising through green bonds india 5.1. As per the economic survey 2019-205, climate bonds worth usd 10.3 billion were issued in the first half of 2019 in india. Climate bonds in india are focused on green bonds, which are specifically linked to climate-change mitigation, adaptation and resilience. 5.2. A number of government agencies have contributed to issuance of such bonds, particularly indian renewable energy development agency (ireda) and the indian railway finance corporation (irfc). 5.3. Currently, green bonds raised by various issuers are listed on india inx. Similarly, various issuers have also issued and listed their bonds on other international stock exchanges such as luxembourg se, singapore exchange, etc. 5.4. Indian companies raised nearly usd 7 billion through esg and green bonds in 2021, compared to usd 1.4 billion and usd 4 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. 5.5. As of february 12, 2020, the outstanding amount of green bonds in india was us$16.3 billion. 4 https: //www. Climatebonds. Net/2022/01/500bn-green-issuance-2021-social-and-sustainable-acceleration-annual-green-1tn- sight-market 5 https: //www. Indiabudget. Gov. In/budget2020-21/economicsurvey/index. Php page 3 of 15 4 5.6. As per economic survey 2020-21 and emerging markets green bonds report 2020, india occupies the 2nd spot (after china) in the cumulative emerging market green bond issuance, 2012-20206. Cumulative emerging market green bond issuance, 2012-2020 (us$ million) 5.7. The above graph shows that in most countries, green bond issuances by corporate entities vastly exceed the issuances by government/ sovereign agencies. The only exceptions are chile, poland, indonesia, hungary, egypt and argentina. 5.8. As on june 30, 2022, under the sebi framework for green bonds, 14 issuers have raised rs. 4,539 crore (about $ 0.5 billion). 6 https: //www. Indiabudget. Gov. In/budget2021-22/economicsurvey/index. Php page 4 of 15 5 5.9. As can be seen from above, there is a stark divergence between the amount raised by listing green bonds in indian jurisdictions versus foreign jurisdictions or autonomous jurisdictions like inx (india international exchange). It may be noted that issuers are finding it more attractive to list on bourses falling outside sebi framework. 5.10. Most of the green bonds issued by indian issuers are listed on offshore exchanges. Informal consultation with the industry participants attribute this to: - lack of demand for such bonds among the indian investors - favourable pricing in overseas market. 6. Scope for sustainable finance in india 6.1 at the cop-26 summit in glasgow, india had made the following commitments towards its climate change goals7: a. Raising non-fossil fuel based energy capacity to 500 gw. B. Lowering total projected carbon emission by one billion tons. C. Meeting 50% of the countrys energy needs through renewable sources. D. Reduce the carbon intensity of the economy to sub 45% level. E. Commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. 6.2 government of india has initiated the following schemes/ policies in pursuit of the goals towards cop-26 targets: a. Commission on air quality management (caqm) - phasing out of coal use in national capital region from january 2023, but exempting thermal power plants using low- sulphur coal. B. National biomass co-firing policy to use biomass like paddy stubble and cow-dung in coal power plants8. C. Mandate the use of flue gas desulphurization (fgd) techniques in both existing and upcoming thermal power plants. D. Government has targeted to achieve 100 million tonnes of coal gasification by 20309. E. National mission on transformative mobility and battery storage10. F. Productivity linked incentives (pli) scheme on advanced cell chemistry and battery storage11. G. India cooling action plan12. 7 https: //www. Mea. Gov. In/speeches- statements. Htm?

Whether the above mentioned initiatives offer any scope for financing through green bonds? B. Please offer comments on whether there are any additional policies/ schemes in line with the above objective, if any? 7. Potential in emerging areas 7.1. The sub-committee constituted by the cobosac had presented its report, which has covered areas like priority sector lending to green sectors, investment by institutional investors, tax recommendation for green bonds and updation of extant guidelines in line with updated green bond principles published by the international capital markets association13. 7.2. There is a need to further channel the investment in emerging areas like data centers which are receiving policy traction (draft data center policy). This field assumes importance in light of government push for data localization and the storage necessities for large volumes of data collected in india. Data centers need tremendous cooling facilities, some of which can be attractive avenues for sustainable finance. 7.3. New concepts like circular economy and regional resource based manufacturing are gaining currency, as a mode to balance job creation with inter-generational environmental equity. Though definitions of these need deeper analysis, there is a need for encouraging flow of green finance in these initiatives. The government of india has presented schemes like one district one product, zero effect zero defect and promotion of these goods through local post offices and railway stations. 7.4. Ecosystem services evaluation- the natural capital accounting and valuation of ecosystem services (ncaves) india forum is being organized by ministry of statistics and programme implementation (mospi) in collaboration with the united nations statistics division (unsd), european union and un environment. India has also implemented the system of environmental economic accounting (seea) which provides policy makers and decision-makers with information that accounts for the value nature contributes to our economies.14 7.5. Agritech companies investing in net-zero for agriculture: - agriculture and allied sectors like animal husbandry are responsible for over 85% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable finance and technology in this sector can take out a major source of climate change. 7.6. National hydrogen mission- india is targeting to produce three-fourths of its hydrogen from renewable resources by 2050.15 7.7. Blue economy and ocean conservation.16 13 https: //www. Icmagroup.

Org/en/news/infographic/2017/06/06/blue-economy page 6 of 15 7 8. Potential for blue bonds 8.1. According to the world bank, the blue economy is the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystem. 17 european commission defines it as all economic activities related to oceans, seas and coasts. 8.2. For a country like india that has a 7500 km long coastline and 14,500 km of navigable inland waterways, the development of blue economy can serve as a growth catalyst in realizing the vision to become a $10 trillion economy by 2032. The blue economy currently comprises 4.1% of indias economy. 8.3. The government of india has kickstarted the initiative to develop the blue economy by announcing project sagarmala, a first of its kind port-led development programme in india. The sagarmala programme plans to bring in development around india's coastal regions based on the following four pillars: port modernization & new port development, port connectivity enhancement & port-linked industrialization. 8.4. The ministry of earth sciences (moes) has rolled out the draft blue economy policy, inviting suggestions and inputs from various stakeholders. 8.5. It emphasizes policies across several key sectors to achieve holistic growth of indias economy. It recognizes the following thematic areas: a. National accounting framework for the blue economy and ocean governance. B. Coastal marine spatial planning and tourism. C. Marine fisheries, aquaculture, and fish processing. D. Manufacturing, emerging industries, trade, technology, services, and skill development. E. Logistics, infrastructure and shipping, including trans-shipments. F. Coastal and deep-sea mining and offshore energy. G. Security, strategic dimensions, and international engagement. H. Indias exclusive economic zone of over 2 million square kilometres has a huge living and non-living resources with significant recoverable resources such as crude oil and natural gas. 9. Scope of blue bonds in india india has tremendous scope for deployment of blue bonds in various aspects of the blue economy, like: 9.1 oceanic resource mining: polymetallic nodules and methane hydrates are abundant in the indian ocean region. Mining of polymetallic nodules present in the seabed in the central indian ocean basin can help india improve availability of nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese. Through an agreement with the international seabed authority, india has a right to explore and mine polymetallic nodules over 750,000 square km.18 17 https: //www. Worldbank.

Is there a need to revisit the existing green bond framework on the lines of the gbps mentioned above? If so, which are the recommendations that have to be adopted? B. Please offer comments on whether any additional policies/ schemes, if any. 11. Greenwashing 11.1. One of the main hurdles for further growth has been a consistent and robust approach to identifying what is considered green. A lack of clarity in this regard leads greenwashing which is defined as the practice of channelling proceeds from green bonds towards projects or activities having negligible or negative environmental benefits. Various issuers page 13 of 15 14 in the past have been accused of greenwashing, and the same has caused significant reputational risk for socially conscious investors seeking to diversify their investment portfolios by investing in environmental, social and governance (esg) practices. 11.2. Bankers and lenders are cautious about financing new asset classes in the green bond market in the absence of adherence to widely accepted standards and taxonomies. On the other hand, no issuer would want to risk their reputation by issuing a bond which is criticized for not being adequately green or transformational, particularly due to lack of availability of a domestic green assessment framework to rate them in a transparent and uniform manner. 11.3. Sebi guidelines on green bonds provide a list of categories wherein funds raised through debt securities are eligible to be classified as green debt securities. 11.4. While china and the european union (eu) have issued their own taxonomies regarding assets eligible to be financed through green bonds, india does not have a detailed taxonomy of such assets. Further, in the absence of the same, major issuers such as sbi, yes bank, ireda etc. Have their own internal green bond frameworks to identify and finance projects. 11.5. In this regard, it is proposed that the list of sectors identified as eligible under the sebi framework may be updated in line with the updated icma guidelines and market feedback/public consultations. 11.6. As per extant regulations, green bonds which do not permit recourse to the issuer are not available in india. However, green revenue bonds or green project bonds as defined by icma are not envisaged under extant sebi regulations. 11.7. Similarly, securitized debt obligations as defined under sebi (issue and listing of securitized debt instruments and security receipts) regulations, 2008 that may have green assets in their underlying asset pool are also excluded from the current framework. 11.8. Feedback is sought regarding addition of such alternative debt securities as defined by icma to be considered as eligible green debt securities. An indicative description of the same is as follows: a. Green revenue bonds which limit exposure to the green project being financed and does not provide recourse to the issuer may b. Green project bond which provides for credit exposure to a single / multiple green projects, with or without recourse to the issuer c. Green securitized bonds collateralized by cash flows from the projects. 11.9. Views/ comments sought on: a. Whether such sub-categorization of green bonds will help reduce greenwashing? B. Please offer comments on whether any additional regulatory/ technical solutions against greenwashing? Page 14 of 15 15 12.

    "# On March 2, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Beaufort Securities Ltd. and Peter Kyriacou, an investment manager at Beaufort, with manipulating the market for HD View 360 Inc., a U.S.-based microcap issuer.  The SEC also announced charges against HD View's CEO, another individual, and three entities they control for manipulating HD View through pump-and-dump schemes.  According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants discussed depositing large blocks of microcap stock in Beaufort accounts, driving up the price of the stock through promotions, manipulating the stock's price and volume through matched trades, and then selling the shares for a large profit.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On March 4, the SEC announced the entry of an order suspending trading in the securities of HD View and for West Coast, pending the outcome of a parallel criminal action by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Following the announcement of the suspension, HD View stock prices and volume increased significantly, and the defendants agreed to pay over $1.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, penalties, and an officer and director bar.  Beaufort agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, and to pay a $1 million civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Patrick McCluskey and Cheryl Crumpton of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office.Â  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of the United Kingdom, the Canadian Securities Commission, the Alberta Securities Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission.\n"
